# Meme Generator ðŸ˜Ž 

This is a very simple Meme Generator app I made just for fun and to practice. It does simple operations such as fetching random memes from various subreddits using the Meme API. The app allows users to generate memes with a single click and displays the meme's title, image, and author.
